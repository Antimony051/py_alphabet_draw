# py_alphabet_draw
draw alphabets by typing them

## how does it work
When the script is active, you can type any string consisting only of alphabets and space and the typed characters will be "drawn" by moving your mouse in a pattern which resembles a seven segment display of the typed character. If any other button is pressed a question mark will be drawn.

## usage
run the python script
open your prefered draw tool and position your mouse from where you would like to draw
press '+' to toggle the script to active state
type desired characters
press '+' to toggle back to inactive state or '-' to end the program
