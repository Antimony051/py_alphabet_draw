## Usage

1. Run the Python script.
2. Open your preferred drawing tool.
3. Position your mouse where you'd like to draw.
4. Press '+' to toggle the script to an active state.
5. Type the desired characters.
6. Press '+' again to toggle back to an inactive state or '-' to end the program.

### Example

- **Activating the Script:** Press '+' to activate the script for drawing.
- **Drawing Characters:** Type alphabets and spaces.
- **Deactivating the Script:** Press '+' to deactivate the drawing script.
- **Exiting the Program:** Press '-' to exit the program.

## Notes

- The script interprets input characters and moves the mouse to "draw" the corresponding seven-segment display of the characters.
- Characters not included in the seven-segment display dictionary will be represented by a question mark.
- Ensure a drawing tool is open and the mouse is positioned correctly before toggling the script to an active state.

## Dependencies

- `pynput`: Used for keyboard input and mouse control.
